# Clarity Contracts - Governance

The `governance` module under `clarity_contracts` contains smart contracts that enable decentralized governance for the Zook Network. This module facilitates community-driven decision-making through proposals, voting, and execution of on-chain actions.

## **Purpose**
The `governance` contracts implement the following core functionalities:

1. **Proposal Management**:
   - Allows users to submit proposals for network upgrades, parameter changes, and new features.

2. **Voting Mechanism**:
   - Facilitates secure and transparent voting on active proposals.

3. **Proposal Execution**:
   - Executes approved proposals to update network parameters or trigger specific actions.

## **Key Contracts**
- **`proposals.clar`**:
  - Manages the lifecycle of proposals, including creation, listing, and status updates.
- **`voting.clar`**:
  - Implements the voting mechanism and tracks voting power.
- **`execution.clar`**:
  - Executes proposals that have been approved by the community.

## **How It Works**
1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - Users submit proposals by calling the `proposals.clar` contract and providing relevant details.

2. **Voting Process**:
   - Voting is conducted through the `voting.clar` contract, which tracks votes and ensures only eligible participants can vote.

3. **Execution of Approved Proposals**:
   - Once a proposal receives sufficient votes, the `execution.clar` contract processes it and applies the changes.

## **Usage**
- **Deploying Contracts**:
  - Use the `scripts/deploy_contracts.sh` script to deploy the governance contracts.
- **Submitting Proposals**:
  - Call the `submit-proposal` function in `proposals.clar` with the proposal details.
- **Voting on Proposals**:
  - Call the `vote` function in `voting.clar` with the proposal ID and vote details.
- **Executing Proposals**:
  - Use the `execute-proposal` function in `execution.clar` once a proposal is approved.

## **Tips for Developers**
- **Testing**:
  - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate proposal submission, voting, and execution workflows.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Extend the governance contracts to support additional types of proposals or custom voting rules.
- **Security**:
  - Ensure proposals and votes are tamper-proof and meet the requirements of cross-layer governance.
