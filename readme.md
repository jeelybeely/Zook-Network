# Zook Network

The Zook Network is an exciting innovation for the BitcoinZ (BTCZ) blockchain, bringing **Layer 2 (L2) functionality** to BTCZ. This groundbreaking platform enables smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and advanced governance mechanisms, all while leveraging the security and decentralization of BTCZ as the underlying blockchain.

## **What is the Zook Network?**

Zook is a **Layer 2 blockchain solution** designed to extend BitcoinZ's capabilities. By integrating with the Stacks ecosystem and utilizing Clarity smart contracts, Zook allows developers and users to:

- Build and deploy custom smart contracts.
- Create decentralized applications (DApps) powered by BTCZ.
- Implement advanced governance models through cross-layer proposals and voting.
- Leverage BTCZ as a secure and immutable foundation for innovation.

This platform transforms BTCZ from a store of value into a **programmable blockchain ecosystem** while maintaining its native decentralization and community-driven ethos.

## **Directory Structure**

### 1. **Clarity Contracts** (`clarity_contracts`)

Contains smart contracts written in Clarity to manage the Zook Network's core functionalities:

- **`bridge`**: Logic for locking BTCZ, minting equivalent `zBTCZ` on L2, and managing burns.
- **`governance`**: Implements cross-layer governance with on-chain proposals and voting.
- **`tokens`**: Provides standards and contracts for native tokens like `zBTCZ` on the Zook Network.

### 2. **Scripts** (`scripts`)

Automation and helper scripts for deploying contracts, interacting with APIs, and managing the network.

### 3. **Source Code** (`src`)

Core backend implementation of the Zook Network:

- **`api`**: REST API endpoints for interacting with the network.
- **`auth`**: Manages authentication and security.
- **`bridge`**: Handles token bridging and synchronization with BTCZ Core.
- **`governance`**: Implements governance workflows and integrations.
- **`rpc`**: Provides RPC services for internal and external interactions.
- **`scripts`**: Helper scripts for internal operations.
- **`tests`**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- **`validator`**: Manages validator registration, compliance, and rewards.

## **How It Works**

1. **Building on BTCZ**:

   - The Zook Network provides a platform where developers can deploy **custom smart contracts** and build decentralized applications.
   - These applications operate on the Zook Network (L2), leveraging BTCZ as the underlying asset and finality layer.

2. **Token Bridging**:

   - BTCZ coins are locked on Layer 1 (L1), and equivalent `zBTCZ` coins are minted on the Zook Network (L2) in a 1:1 ratio.
   - When `zBTCZ` is burned, the corresponding BTCZ is unlocked on L1.

3. **Governance**:

   - Zook enables cross-layer governance, allowing BTCZ and Zook users to propose and vote on system changes.
   - Decisions can impact both L2 smart contracts and L1 integrations.

4. **Validator Rewards**:

   - Validators are rewarded for maintaining the network and complying with governance policies.
   - Dynamic reward structures can be adjusted through governance proposals.

## **Building on Zook**

Zook empowers developers to build on BTCZ through a seamless development experience:

1. **Set Up Development Environment**:

   - Install Clarity CLI tools and configure the Stacks development environment.

2. **Create Smart Contracts**:

   - Write your Clarity contract in a new module under `clarity_contracts/<your-module>`.
   - Use existing modules like `bridge` or `governance` as templates for best practices.

3. **Deploy Contracts**:

   - Use deployment scripts in the `scripts` directory to deploy and initialize your contracts.

4. **Interact with APIs**:

   - Access the Zook Network's API layer to integrate your contract with external applications.

5. **Test Thoroughly**:

   - Write unit tests in Clarity and integration tests in `src/tests` to ensure your contract functions as expected.

Zook makes it easy for developers to expand the BitcoinZ ecosystem while ensuring compatibility and performance.

## **Why Zook Matters**

The Zook Network is a game-changer for the BitcoinZ community, unlocking endless possibilities:

- **Programmable BTCZ**: Transition BTCZ from a store of value to a programmable asset powering DApps and smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Innovation**: Foster community-driven growth with transparent governance.
- **Secure Foundation**: Build on BTCZ's proven decentralization and immutability.

With Zook, BitcoinZ evolves into a modern blockchain ecosystem ready to compete with the best in the industry.

## **Maintenance Tips**

- Regularly update Clarity contracts to ensure compatibility with the latest Stacks version.
- Monitor and maintain synchronization between BTCZ Core and Zook Network.
- Validate all RPC and API responses during upgrades to avoid breaking changes.
- Document any custom modules or extensions for easy onboarding of future contributors.
